            <p>Hello, My Manic Beauties and Handsomes! 
                This is the piercer Luna, I wanted to check in and do a quick get to know me post so you know some stuff about me and some of the things I do! So without further a due let's start this off! 
                Hi! I'm Luna (lol obviously) and I've been piercing for 6 years now! It's a job I've always been passionate about because it allows me to help give back to you to where you get to reclaim your body and have your mark to the world! Which in my eyes there is nothing better than making your body yours. 
                I start my piercings at 6 years and up; this is because of body anatomy and not being grown into your ears til a certain age! As we don't want any migrations are accidental rip outs!
                I am able to do any and all piercings male and female from head to toe, BUT I must stress we will review your body anatomy first because I'm in the business of making you love yourself and if you have a rejection or get badly scared or an infection than that you won't love and I won't have done my job properly! This is about you after all!!! 
                Some Other Services I Offer:
                I also do henna art, which is semi-permanent ink that is all natural and lasts anywhere from 3-4 weeks depending on the area and how you take care of it which is available for all ages 6 and up!!! I also have been known to offer tarot card readings as well depending on your interest and what you wanna know and explore about yourself, your job, or even your relationship, or let the cards decide and it'll be a wild journey of discovery!
                I also offer correctional services if you got an infection from anything regarding any piercings even if they didn't come from this shop! Like I said we really want you to love what you get, and sometimes were able to save it entirely depending on how honest you are about it and what is going on symptom wise! So please don't be shy!!!
                Now A Bit About Me:
                I'm 28 years old and like I said I've been at this for 6 years and absolutely LOVE doing this. I am a witchy/hippie vibe, and your comfortability is what matters most to me! So never fear! I am here for you, the one I am creating for, and your wishes will be respected! I do own two cats myself and I am in fact pregnant so you may catch me snacking on food constantly! Don't let this scare you away you aren't at risk of being eaten!!! haha. 
                Disclaimers:
                If wanting the lower regions piercings (genital) please call ahead of time and get it scheduled so I can make sure I have everything prepared for your piercing and properly prep, you ahead of time!
                Please make sure if you are bringing in your minor for a piercing know that from ages 6-12 all I offer are ear piercings this is largely due to anatomy reasons and not wanting migration issues but also out of respect for schools and their deans, also with consideration of the world we live in today. I will also ask that only parents bring in their children, as I'll need the parents ID and the child's birth certificate to make sure everything is square with our health inspector. If your last name does not match your child's last name, I will require proof of name change as we need to make sure this child belongs to you or else, I'll go to jail üôÅ for endangerment of a minor! 
                Closing Note:
                After all that here is my final word to you; Come on by, give us a call, or contact me directly! it may take a few moments for me to reply back
